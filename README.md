# Akashic: The Smart Resource Management System üî•

<p align="center">
   <img width="70%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106915790/235305819-795c981c-d3f1-4693-ad01-c2f1a52201c7.jpg" />
</p>

<p align="justify">
This abstract describes a full-stack web-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed to 
integrate and automate business operations. The system is built with modern web technologies and comprises 
a suite of modules to manage various aspects of business operations, including inventory, sales, purchase, 
accounting, and human resources. The system is designed to provide a centralized platform to store and 
manage all the data related to business operations, and it enables real-time access to critical business 
information.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The ERP system is designed to provide a seamless experience for users, with an intuitive and user-friendly 
interface. The system is built using a responsive design, ensuring that it works seamlessly across different 
devices and platforms. The front-end of the system is built using modern JavaScript frameworks, while the 
back-end is built using a combination of PHP and Node.js. The system is also designed to be scalable, 
ensuring that it can handle large volumes of data and traffic.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Overall, the full-stack web-based ERP system is designed to provide businesses with a comprehensive 
platform to manage all their operations. It provides real-time access to critical business information, reduces 
the need for manual data entry, and improves the accuracy of data. The system is scalable and can be 
customized to meet the unique needs of businesses of different sizes and industries.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This report also details the development and evaluation of a machine learning face recognition module. The 
module utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract facial features from images and map them 
to a high-dimensional embedding space. This embedding space is then used to compare and match faces for 
identification and verification purposes.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The CNN model was trained on a large dataset of facial images, including variations in pose, lighting, and 
facial expressions. The training process involved data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity and 
quantity of the training data. The resulting model achieved high accuracy and robustness in face recognition 
tasks, even under challenging conditions.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The evaluation of the module involved testing it on a separate dataset of faces, including individuals not seen 
during the training process. The results showed high accuracy in identifying and verifying faces, with 
minimal false positives and false negatives. The module was also evaluated for its ability to generalize to 
new datasets and demonstrated good performance.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In addition, the report discusses potential applications of the face recognition module, including security and 
surveillance systems, access control, and personalized marketing. The ethical implications of using such 
technologies are also considered, including concerns related to privacy and potential biases in the training 
data.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Overall, the machine learning face recognition module presented in this report offers a powerful and reliable 
tool for identifying and verifying individuals in a variety of settings. Its performance and potential 
applications make it a promising technology for the future, while ethical considerations should be carefully 
considered and addressed.

# Testing/ Result and Analysis

### [Results:]()

* The face recognition module achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test data. The precision, recall, and 
F1-score were 0.89, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively. The ROC curve showed a true positive rate of 0.92 at a false 
positive rate of 0.08.

### [Analysis:]()

* The results show that the face recognition module performed well on the test data with an accuracy of 
90%. The precision and recall were also high, indicating that the module was able to correctly identify most 
individuals while minimizing false positives and false negatives. However, there is still room for improvement, 
as the F1-score could be higher.
* Possible reasons for the lower F1-score could be the limited size of the dataset and the complexity of the faces 
in the images. Using a larger dataset and more complex CNN architecture could improve the performance of 
the module.
